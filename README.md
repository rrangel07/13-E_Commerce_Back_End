## Description

In this ever-evolving world, technology is a major part of our everyday. With the advancement of technology, a lot of our daily activities are turning “digital” from being “analogical”. Shopping is one of them, we believe that every shop store should have the chance to give the big jump from physical to digital. With that in mind we developed a back end app that is going to allow any big or small store to easily have control over every aspect of their products information and inventory.
